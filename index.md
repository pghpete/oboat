# OBOAT OBAL-base Unmanned Autonomous Bathymetry Boat

**Goal:**

The goal of this project is to create an autonomous boat that can be deployed in bodies of water and measure the depth, guided by gps way-points and return to launch. Using the data collected us GIS software to produce a map of the river bed.  Document and share the entire process from building the vehicle to gathering the data and producing the resulting charts and maps.

**Software:**
- Ardurover
- Raspberry Pi OS Lite

**Hardware:**
- OBAL - Open Board Architecture for Linux will act as the heart of the system. _Thank You Mohammad for a fantastic board and project_
